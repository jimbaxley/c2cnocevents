## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start Development
The web server is already running! View your app at:
- **VS Code Simple Browser**: Available in the editor
- **External Browser**: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Make Changes
Edit any Dart file in `lib/` and see changes instantly:
- UI changes appear immediately
- State is preserved during hot reload
- Errors appear in VS Code terminal

### 3. Access Features
- **Settings Menu**: Click ⚙️ in top-right corner
- **Coda Setup**: Settings → "Coda Integration"
- **Notifications**: Settings → "Notification Settings"

### 4. Common Tasks
Use VS Code Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`):
- **Tasks: Run Task** → Select from available Flutter tasks
- **Debug: Start Debugging** → Run with debugger attached

## Next Steps

### For Coda Integration
1. Create a Coda document with events table
2. Get API credentials from [Coda Account Settings](https://coda.io/account)
3. Configure in app: Settings → Coda Integration
4. Enable Coda integration toggle

### For Development
1. **Add Features**: Create new screens/widgets in respective folders
2. **Modify Styling**: Edit `lib/theme.dart` for app-wide changes
3. **Update Data**: Modify `EventService` for new event logic
4. **Test Changes**: Use hot reload for instant feedback

## File Structure Quick Reference

```
lib/
├── main.dart                     # App entry point
├── screens/
│   ├── home_screen.dart         # Main event listing
│   ├── coda_settings_screen.dart # Coda configuration
│   └── ...
├── services/

│   └── ...
└── models/
    ├── event.dart               # Event data structure
    └── ...
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Hot reload not working**: Save the file or press `R` in terminal
- **Build errors**: Check VS Code terminal for detailed error messages
- **Coda connection issues**: Verify API credentials in settings
- **Port conflicts**: Stop other servers using port 3000

Happy coding! 🚀
